Yes, I know lots of people hated it. But it was an amazing tool for quick prototypes.  There are some projects that I keep revisiting, and over time I'm converting them to HTML5.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLast year I converted my <a href=\"https://simblob.blogspot.com/2022/06/procedural-tree-generator.html\">Flash procedural tree generator</a> (succeeded) and attempted to convert my <a href=\"https://www.redblobgames.com/x/2216-spaceship-flyer/\">Flash spaceship flyer</a> (failed).

I didn't do anything about it. But then I was working on a <a href=\"https://simblob.blogspot.com/2023/01/making-of-circle-drawing.html\">tutorial about how I make my interactive tutorials</a>, I had to show how to handle touch events, and I was <em>embarrassed</em> by my code. I decided to take a week to learn about mouse, touch, and pointer events.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat week turned into two. And three. And eight.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>I learned a lot</strong>. Not only about the event handling spec, but also differences in browser behavior and operating system behavior.\n</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.redblobgames.com/making-of/draggable/build/mouse-and-touch.svg\">\n  <figcaption>State diagram for mouse and touch events</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>\nI was able to greatly simplify my code by using newer APIs and by removing unnecessary code.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"jump-link\">\n<a href=\"https://simblob.blogspot.com/2023/02/making-of-draggable-objects.html#more\">\nRead more »\n</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"blogger-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a class=\"p-category\" href=\"https://simblob.blogspot.com/search/label/making-of\" rel=\"tag\">\nmaking-of\n</a>\n</p>\n<div class=\"byline\">\n                  – \n                  <a class=\"p-author h-card\" href=\"http://www.redblobgames.com/\">\nAmit\n</a>\n                  – \n                  Tuesday, February 28, 2023\n\n                      – \n                      <a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5052387&amp;postID=1523496150458764225\" onclick=\"\">\n0\n                          comments\n                        \n</a>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n</div>","retrieved":1696037276509},{"title":"Making-of: circle drawing page (Blobs in Games)","contents":"<h2 class=\"p-name\">\n<span><a href=\"https://simblob.blogspot.com/2023/01/making-of-circle-drawing.html\">Making-of: circle drawing page</a></span>\n<a class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://simblob.blogspot.com/2023/01/making-of-circle-drawing.html\">#</a>\n</h2>\n<time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2023-01-17T20:03:00-08:00\">Tuesday, January 17, 2023</time>\n<p>\nPeople sometimes ask me how I write my interactive tutorials. I started out using <a href=\"https://d3js.org/\">d3.js</a>, and five years ago I wrote <a href=\"https://www.redblobgames.com/making-of/line-drawing/\">an interactive tutorial about how I made interactive pages with d3.js</a>. I recreated a diagram from my <a href=\"https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/line-drawing/\">line drawing tutorial</a>, which was implemented in d3.js. I now use <a href=\"https://v3.vuejs.org/\">Vue.js v2</a>, so I wrote a new tutorial about how I make interactive pages with Vue. I recreated several diagrams from my <a href=\"https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/circle-drawing/\">circle drawing tutorial</a>.\n</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <a href=\"https://www.redblobgames.com/making-of/circle-drawing/\"><img alt=\"Diagram constructed in layers\" src=\"https://www.redblobgames.com/making-of/circle-drawing/blog/layers-diagram.png\"></a>\n</figure>\n<div class=\"jump-link\">\n<a href=\"https://simblob.blogspot.com/2023/01/making-of-circle-drawing.html#more\">\nRead more »\n</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"blogger-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a class=\"p-category\" href=\"https://simblob.blogspot.com/search/label/howto\" rel=\"tag\">\nhowto\n</a>\n\n                        ,\n                      \n<a class=\"p-category\" href=\"https://simblob.blogspot.com/search/label/making-of\" rel=\"tag\">\nmaking-of\n</a>\n\n                        ,\n                      \n<a class=\"p-category\" href=\"https://simblob.blogspot.com/search/label/vue\" rel=\"tag\">\nvue\n</a>\n</p>\n<div class=\"byline\">\n                  – \n                  <a class=\"p-author h-card\" href=\"http://www.redblobgames.com/\">\nAmit\n</a>\n                  – \n                  Tuesday, January 17, 2023\n\n                      – \n                      <a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5052387&amp;postID=3565397690848543014\" onclick=\"\">\n0\n                          comments\n                        \n</a>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n</div>","retrieved":1696037276510}]}
